<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Bento Core Data Model supports the Bento software framework that has been developed to stand up data sharing platforms for clinical trials and research programs. Modern clinical trials and research programs generate large volumes of complex biomedical data types. To address this complexity the Bento Core Data model uses a graph structure to model a clinical trial workflow. Key trial entities are modelled as <em>node types</em>, while the association between nodes are explicitly modelled as <em>relationship types</em>.</p>
<p>The Bento Core Data Model has been extended to fit the TAILORx clinical data set. The extended model, also called the <strong>BENTO_TAILORx</strong> data model, comprises of 20 node types and 37 relationship types that are listed in the section <strong>BENTO_TAILORx Node Types</strong> and <strong>Table 1</strong>, respectively. Both nodes and relationships store data attributes in the form of properties. These data attributes are listed in the section <strong>BENTO_TAILORx Attribute Types</strong>. The BENTO_TAILORx graph data model has been implemented in Neo4J, a commercial graph database platform.</p>

<li><p><strong>Study Subject:</strong> A matter or an individual that is observed, analyzed, examined, investigated, experimented upon, or/and treated in the course of a particular study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross Reference Database:</strong> A data repository that cross-references a study subject.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sample:</strong> Any material sample taken from a biological entity for testing, diagnostic, propagation, treatment or research purposes, including a sample obtained from a living organism or taken from the biological object after halting of all its life functions. Sample can contain one or more components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory products. The preferred name of this node type in the NCI Metathesaurus is “Biospecimen”.</p></li>
